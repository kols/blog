**Verse1**

{% highlight text %}
How many streets must we pass by,
before you become useless?
How many leaves must bury their mom,
before they choke you breathe?
How many papers and coins will feed our needs,
before they become ashes and mud?
{% endhighlight %}

**Refrain**

{% highlight text %}
The answer my friend, is floating beyond the cloud.
The answer is floating beyond the cloud.
{% endhighlight %}

**Verse2**

{% highlight text %}
How many times could we talk to myself,
before you speak, shout and cry?
How many envs will be left untouched,
before you no longer write and all?
How many times should we say that we're fine,
before you pull the trigger and bang?
{% endhighlight %}

***Repeat refrain***


**Verse3**

{% highlight text %}
How many years will we grow we fail,
before you're grown you don't fear?
How many times could we be afraid,
before you can never be afraid?
How many souls must be wasted rotten,
before you say you love him?
{% endhighlight %}

***Repeat refrain***


###Commenting

The title *Floating beyond the cloud* means you should find the answer
beyond the common sense. It's from your imaginations, your chaos and
your beautiful or ugly little secrets, because beyond the cloud we don't
know what's there. And if you know, you might already find some answers
that mean to yourself.
